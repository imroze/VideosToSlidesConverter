Today we'll talk about one of the most ubiquitous problems in AI called

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:08,500
classification. Classification is mapping sets of percepts in the world into

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,810
equals classes, so that we can take actions in the world in an efficient manner.

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,630
We could learn this concept through incremental concept learning.

5
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,070
We'll talk about the nature of these equivalence classes and

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,940
how they can be organized into a hierarchy of concepts. We'll talk about

7
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:32,049
different kinds of concepts, like axiomatic concepts and prototypical concepts.

8
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:38,880
Given a classification hierarchy, we'll talk about multiple processes for

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,584
doing the classification, including both bottom-up and top-down processes.
