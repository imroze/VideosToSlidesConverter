1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,010
To see why classification is so powerful and

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:06,870
so ubiquitous, and also to understand what exactly is classification,

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,930
let us go to our overall cognitive architecture for an intelligent agent.

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,329
This is a diagram that we have come across many, many times. Let us

5
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:20,560
imagine this particular Cognitive System is dealing with a set of percepts.

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,120
These percepts are in the world. So as an example this Cognitive System may see

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,010
some object, some animal when the Cognitive System goes to the zoo.

8
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,290
This might be an AI agent, or perhaps your friend who goes to the zoo.

9
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:37,090
And look at some animals and there are a large number of

10
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:41,910
percepts in that environment. Has wings, Has feathers, talons, beak and

11
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,430
so on. And for the simplicity let's assume that each of the percepts is binary,

12
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:51,180
it's either true or false. So either the animal has wings or doesn't have wings.

13
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,190
And depending upon the percepts and the combinations of this percepts one might

14
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,040
take different kind of actions. So if it's a friendly animal one might go and

15
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,400
pet it, if it's a unfriendly or dangerous animal one might run away from it.

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,690
So, all kind of actions are possible. Imagine that there are some M actions that

17
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:15,790
are possible. Send, we can again imagine that there is a binary choice here.

18
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:19,380
So, the total number of combinations of actions, as 2 to the power m.

19
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,930
So as an example. If I have a, if I see a dangerous animal in a zoo,

20
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:29,150
then I might both scream and run away. If I see a friendly animal,

21
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:34,280
I may approach the animal and make cooing noise to the animal. So, a number of

22
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,180
actions and combinations of actions are possible. And if n is the number of

23
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:43,400
percepts then I have 2 to the power n. Combinations of percepts possible. So

24
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,489
how is the challenge that the cognitive agent faces? The challenges,

25
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:51,800
that the number of percepts and the number of actions multiplied by the number

26
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,080
of combinations of percepts and the number of combinations of actions is very,

27
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,360
very large. And we have to map these percepts, combinations of percepts,

28
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,030
actions, combinations of actions. This is a very complex mapping. So

29
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,870
imagine that only 10 percepts. Image at environment, so I'm looking at

30
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:14,330
an animal and let's take 10 percepts that I'm paying attention to.

31
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:17,970
Then two to the power 10, the number of combination of percepts is 1024, and

32
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,580
doing it two to the power of 10 here because I'm assuming each percept has

33
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:27,080
a binary value. If I had 100 percepts, I was not looking at one animal, but

34
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,320
I was looking at a scene of animals. Then I may have 100 percepts,

35
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,070
in which case I have a much larger number of combinations. And

36
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,540
if I had something like 300 percepts, which is not very large number.

37
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,550
The number of combinations is, well it's a very large number.

38
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,780
more than the combinations of atoms in the universe. Now you and

39
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:50,690
I, and AI agents more generally. Are constantly faced with a complex environment

40
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:53,560
where there are a large number of percepts, and a large number of combinations

41
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,150
that are possible. So let's go back to something earlier that we had considered

42
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:03,410
in the class. We defined earlier that, one way of talking what intelligent agent

43
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:08,870
is to think in terms of how can an intelligent agent map percepts into actions.

44
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,640
Intelligence is, in part, a lot part perhaps, according to this definition,

45
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,300
about action selection. The other aspect of this is.

46
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,390
That if the number of perceptions is large and the number of actions is large.

47
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:24,850
Then the mapping between them becomes very large and very complicated quickly.

48
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:29,350
But intelligent agents have only finite resources. How is it then that we can

49
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:34,090
select the right action. Or at least most of the time select the right action.

50
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:38,070
Even when the environment is very complex. And do so in near real time.
