1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,150
Today we'll talk about
incremental concept learning.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,420
In case based reasoning,
we're storing new examples in memory.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:11,400
Today we'll talk about how we can
abstract concepts out of those examples.

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,880
This is our second major
topic of learning.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,940
We'll start with the learning goal.

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,300
Then we'll talk about very near spaces
of learning like variabilization,

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,919
specialization, and generalization.

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,480
We'll also talk about heuristics for
specializing and

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,530
generalizing concepts as
examples come in incrementally.
