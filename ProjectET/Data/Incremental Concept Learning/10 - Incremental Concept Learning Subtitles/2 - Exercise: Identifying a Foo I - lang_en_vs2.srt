00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,150
Let us try to do a problem together on incremental concept learning.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:08,150
I'm going to give you a series of examples, and we will see what kind of

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:12,190
concept one can learn from it. I'll not tell you what the concept really is, for

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:16,730
the time being I'm just going to call it foo. Here is the first example.

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,520
In this first example, there are four bricks. A brick at the bottom,

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,040
horizontal brick at the bottom, or horizontal brick at the top. And two vertical

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,310
bricks on the side. Here is a second example. And this time I'll tell you

8
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:33,980
that this particular example is not a positive instance of the concept foo.

9
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:38,930
Once again, we have four bricks, a brick at the bottom, a brick at the top, and

10
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:43,110
two bricks on the side. This time the two bricks aren't touching each other.

11
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:50,118
Here's a third example of the concept foo. This is a positive example.

12
00:00:50,118 --> 00:00:54,230
This is a foo. Again we have four blocks. This time they are two bricks,

13
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:59,580
and instead of having two bricks, vertical bricks, we have two cylinders.

14
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:05,379
They are not touching each other. So I showed you three examples of the concept

15
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:10,310
foo. And I'm sure, you learned some concept definition out of it.

16
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,275
Now I'm going to show you another example and ask you,

17
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:20,510
does this example fit your current definition of concept foo, what do you think?
