00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,370
Let us look at the algorithm for incremental concept learning more systematical

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:11,010
in more detail. This time, imagine that there is an AI program, and there is

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,810
a teacher which is going to teach the AI program about the concept of an arch.

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:20,600
So teaching this first example and suppose the teacher gives the example which

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,520
has four bricks in it. Two vertical bricks that are not touching each other and

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,568
there is a third brick on top of it and a fourth brick on top of it. To the AI

7
00:00:30,568 --> 00:00:35,657
program, the input may look a little bit like this, there are four bricks, A, B,

8
00:00:35,657 --> 00:00:40,750
C and D. And there are some relationships between these four blocks. So

9
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:47,020
brick C is on left of brick D. Brick C supports brick B. Brick D

10
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:52,930
supports brick B as well, and brick B supports brick A. This then is the input.

11
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:57,680
What may the error program learn from this one, single example?

12
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,480
Not very much. For this one single example, the AI program can only variablize.

13
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,820
There were these constants here, brick A, brick B, brick C, brick D.

14
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:14,310
Instead, the AI program may be able to variablize these constants and say, well,

15
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,370
brick A is an instance of brick, and therefore, I just have brick here.

16
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:22,100
Brick B is an instance of a brick. Therefore, I'll just have a brick here. So

17
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,500
now, I can have any brick in these spaces as long as these relationships hold,

18
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:31,450
it's an example of an arch. Note the first example was the positive example.

19
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:35,090
Now we are going to see a series of positive and negative examples, and

20
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,740
each time we see an example, the AI program will either generalize or

21
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:44,580
specialize. If it sees a positive example, then it may generalize,

22
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:48,800
if the positive example is not covered by a current concept definition.

23
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,870
If it sees a negative example, it may specialize the current definition of

24
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,290
the concept to exclude that negative example.
