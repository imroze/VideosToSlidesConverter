Here is a summary of the kind of Heuristics that an AI agent might use in

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,394
criminal concept learning. You only come across five of them,

3
00:00:07,394 --> 00:00:13,125
require-link, forbid-link, drop-link, enlarge-set and

4
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:18,190
climb-tree. Here is another one called close-interval, let's look at it briefly.

5
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,190
Let's go to David's example of a child having a dog and

6
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:25,950
suppose that child has only come across dogs that were very small in size.

7
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,810
Now the child comes across a large dog. In that case the child might change

8
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,090
the concept definition, expand the range of values that the dog can take,

9
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,080
that dog size can take so that the larger dog can be included. So the difference

10
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,200
here being that it's values can be continuous like size of a dog and

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,260
sort of indiscreet as in the other hero sticks
