00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,370
Let us continue this exercise a little bit further.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:08,060
Imagine that the teacher gives this as a third example to the AI program.

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,380
This time again you have three bricks, but the two vertical bricks

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:16,780
are touching each other. So here is a representation of this input example.

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:21,630
Three bricks, the two vertical bricks are supporting this brick at the top,

6
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,910
however, the two bricks are touching each other. Recall, this is the current

7
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:30,870
concept definition that the AI program has. It mus support links here.

8
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,720
And here is the representation of the new example. And the AI program knows that

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,900
this is a negative example. How might the AI program refine or

10
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:43,020
specialize this particular current definition, so that this negative example is

11
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,930
excluded? Well, AI program may say that the current definition can be devised in

12
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:52,460
such a way that for these two bricks, where one is left of the other one,

13
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,580
these two bricks cannot touch each other. This particular symbol means not.

14
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,570
So it is saying that this brick does not touch that one. And

15
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,670
we have bi-datashield links. Because this one cannot touch the other one, and

16
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,880
that one cannot touch this one. This is called a forbid-link heuristic. So,

17
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,330
here some particular link, in this particular case touches, is being forbidden.
