&gt;&gt; Once again, David, is using his background knowledge.

2
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,570
In his background knowledge he says that the bricks are like the cylinders.

3
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:24,240
The vertical bricks are like the vertical cylinders. So, what holds for

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,210
the vertical bricks, they must not be touching, also holds for

5
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,050
the vertical cylinders. They too must not be touching. Again, someone else may

6
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,840
have a different background knowledge and may come up with a different answer.
