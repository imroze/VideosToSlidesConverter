Lets try one last example in this series. So, in this example,

2
00:00:04,811 --> 00:00:08,904
there are four blocks again. There are three bricks at the bottom and

3
00:00:08,904 --> 00:00:12,930
two on the side, not touching each other. And there is a wedge this time at

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,230
the top, not a brick. Is this an example of the concept foo?
