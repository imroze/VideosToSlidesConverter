&gt;&gt; And in coming up to this answer David used some background knowledge.

2
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,190
The background knowledge that he used was that the bricks that were

3
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:28,160
in the vertical position in the first example, and the cylinders that were in

4
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,600
the vertical position in the third example, and the special blocks that are in

5
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:37,680
the vertical position in this example. Are all examples of something called

6
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,720
a block. They can be replaced by each other. So instead of having a brick,

7
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,660
one could have a cylinder, or some other thing that's vertically placed here.

8
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,810
Now, someone else in the class may have a different background knowledge, and

9
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:57,120
he or she may not consider this to be an example of a block, in which

10
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,390
case the answer might be no. The point here being that background knowledge is

11
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:05,000
playing an important role in deciding whether or not this is an example of foo.
