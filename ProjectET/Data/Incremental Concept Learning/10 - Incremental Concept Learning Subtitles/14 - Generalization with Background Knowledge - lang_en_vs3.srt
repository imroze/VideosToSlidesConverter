1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,441
Now let us suppose that the AI
program had background knowledge,

2
00:00:03,441 --> 00:00:07,620
which said that brick is a kind of block
and wedge is a kind of block as well.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,610
In that case, the AI program may
use this background knowledge to

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,790
further revise this current concept
definition and replace this brick or

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:21,390
wedge by a block, because both bricks
and wedges are examples of blocks.

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,880
So we'll call this
a climb-tree heuristic.

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,730
Here is a tree of background knowledge,
we're climbing the tree.

8
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,190
Note another interesting aspect of this.

9
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:34,280
Suppose that there was under the kind of
block that was possible, say a cylinder.

10
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,780
So now that the AI program has
generalized from brick and

11
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,100
wedge into a block, and
this is the current definition.

12
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,720
If a new example comes along and
it has a cylinder at the top here,

13
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,470
that would be covered by
this particular concept.

14
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:53,695
And this AI program would be able to
recognize that particular instance which

15
00:00:53,695 --> 00:00:58,390
had the cylinder at the top as
an example of this concept definition.

16
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:03,130
That is the power of being able to use
this background knowledge to generalize.

17
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,810
The more we know, the more we can learn.

18
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:09,010
&gt;&gt; So it sounds like this is actually
an example of what I was doing earlier.

19
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,898
I had said that because
I saw a brick and

20
00:01:10,898 --> 00:01:14,800
a cylinder both playing the same role,
that they were both examples of block.

21
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,880
And therefore,
any block could play that role.

22
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,830
Then when I saw that funny kind of
little arch shape holding up

23
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,075
the block on top, I inferred that
that would also be an acceptable

24
00:01:23,075 --> 00:01:25,800
answer because both brick and
cylinders were blocks.

25
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,840
And I generalized out to say
any block could play that role.

26
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,880
&gt;&gt; Good connection, David.
