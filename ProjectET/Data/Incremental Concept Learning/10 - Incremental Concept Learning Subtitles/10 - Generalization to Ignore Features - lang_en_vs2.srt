1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,230
Now suppose that the teacher gives the error program this example as the second

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:09,390
example, and the teacher also tells the error program this is a positive

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:14,260
example, so these are labeled examples. Here's a representation of the second

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:18,840
example. Again, I have done the variabilization, so the constant here, Brick A,

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,580
has been replaced by Brick. This was the current concept definition of the AI

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,190
program for the concept of arch. And here is a new example.

7
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:33,080
How should the AI programmer revise its current concept definition of an arch in

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:38,320
order to accommodate this positive example? Because it is a positive example,

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,070
therefore the AI program should try to generalize. So one good way of

10
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,848
generalizing the current concept definition is to drop this link.

11
00:00:44,848 --> 00:00:49,140
If the AI program can drop this link, in that case this will be

12
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,240
the new current concept definition. Note that this current

13
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,850
concept definition covers both the second example, as well as the first example.

14
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,770
This is called the drop-link heuristic. It's a heuristic because as we

15
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,058
discussed earlier, a heuristic is a rule of thumb. So here is what has happened.

16
00:01:07,058 --> 00:01:11,330
When an AI program needs to learn from a very small set of examples,

17
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:16,530
just one example or two examples, then the possible generalizations and

18
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,050
specializations, the learning space, is potentially very large.

19
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:25,240
In order to guide the AI program about how to navigate the learning space, we'll

20
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,060
develop some heuristics. The first such heuristic is drop a link if you need to

21
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,540
generalize in such a way that the new concept can cover both earlier examples.

22
00:01:36,684 --> 00:01:41,490
So drop-link heuristic is useful when the structure of the current

23
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,650
concept definition and the structure of the new example have a lot of overlap.

24
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:52,670
They overlap almost exactly, except for one link that is extra in

25
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:57,940
the current concept definition. The extra link can be dropped because in the new

26
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:02,370
definition will cover both the previous concept as well as the new example.
