1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,360
Now let us look at examples that are even more interesting than previously.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,390
Recall that earlier we were talking about background knowledge.

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,240
Let's see what role background knowledge plays more explicitly. So

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,400
imagine this is the fourth example that the teacher gives to the AI program, and

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,820
this is a positive example. So the AI program may have this as the input

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,830
representation. There are two bricks, this brick is left of the other brick,

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,810
there's a wedge on top, the two bricks are supporting the wedge. So now the AI

8
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,400
program has this as the current definition, recall the not touches links here,

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,470
and this is the new example. And this is the positive example. How may the AI

10
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:41,590
program revise its current concept definition to include this positive example?

11
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:46,050
Well the simplest in the AI program I do is to replace this brick here,

12
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,420
in the current concept definition by brick or wedge. So

13
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:54,380
that makes sure that a new example is included in the definition of the concept.

14
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,560
We'll call this the enlarge-set heuristic. This particular set here, which had

15
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,700
only brick here as an element, now has two elements in it; brick or wedge.
