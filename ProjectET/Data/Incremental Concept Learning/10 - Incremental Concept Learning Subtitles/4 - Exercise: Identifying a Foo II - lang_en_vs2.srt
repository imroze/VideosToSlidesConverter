00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,250
Let's try another example. This time,

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,200
again, there are four blocks. There are two bricks, at the bottom and

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:11,390
the top. And the two cylinders, both vertical, but they are touching each other.

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:15,100
Is this an example of the concept foo based on what we have learned so far?
