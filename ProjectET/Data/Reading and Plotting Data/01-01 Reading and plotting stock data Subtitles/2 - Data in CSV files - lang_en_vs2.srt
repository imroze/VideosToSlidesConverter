1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,560
Our objective in this class is to get
you up and running quickly, to show you

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,620
some real data, and some code you can
use to view it and manipulate it.

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:13,610
And just give you a feeling
that you know what's going on.

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,570
So we're going to take you
from examples of raw data

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,340
all the way to visualization.

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,250
Now let's get started with the data.

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:27,223
In this class we're going to
work almost entirely with

8
00:00:27,223 --> 00:00:30,282
data that comes from CSV files.

9
00:00:30,282 --> 00:00:33,916
CSV files are plain text.

10
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:39,940
The C stands for comma, S stands for
separated, V is values.

11
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,410
So comma-separated values.

12
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,800
Let me show you an example of
what might be in a CSV file.

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,070
Most CVS files start with a header line.

14
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,326
In this example,

15
00:00:52,326 --> 00:00:56,863
this is a CSV file that's telling
us about weather conditions.

16
00:00:56,863 --> 00:01:00,417
So we've got temperature,
pressure and humidity and

17
00:01:00,417 --> 00:01:05,430
that tells us what information is
in the columns that are to follow.

18
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:11,310
Following our header line we
have lines or rows of data.

19
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,168
So these numbers here make up our data.

20
00:01:13,168 --> 00:01:15,950
Again, header row and

21
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:20,260
rows of data, where each data
element is separated by a comma.

22
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:24,970
Now the files that we're going to be
working with, the stock data files,

23
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:30,300
have thousands of lines and
many more columns as well.

24
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:38,180
Our objective for this lesson is to
show you how to read in data like this,

25
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,880
focus, say, on one column or another,
and create a plot from that data.

26
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,430
Okay, so
now you've seen an example with weather.

27
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,290
Let's start thinking about stocks.
