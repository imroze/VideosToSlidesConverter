Hi I'm Tucker.

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:03,140
&gt;&gt; And I'm Dev.

3
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:07,900
&gt;&gt; Welcome to this mini course,
Manipulating Financial Data in Python.

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,410
Our goal is to give you
a quick introduction to

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,920
the skills you'll need to work
with financial data in Python.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,875
Now, some people complain
about our choice of Python for

7
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:21,020
financial applications.

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,390
&gt;&gt; I don't agree with those people.

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,590
Python allows you to quickly
prototype algorithms

10
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,350
while also providing
computational speed.

11
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,420
It has a number of features.

12
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,070
Firstly, it has strong
scientific libraries.

13
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,230
Second, it is strongly maintained.

14
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,330
It is also fast if you can stick to
metrics notation because lower levels

15
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:44,564
are returned in C.

16
00:00:44,564 --> 00:00:47,755
&gt;&gt; Some other potential languages
that might have made sense for

17
00:00:47,755 --> 00:00:49,542
this course include R and MATLAB.

18
00:00:49,542 --> 00:00:54,160
Which are themselves also great
languages for financial data.

19
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,100
But we've chosen Python and
we'll be using this book Python for

20
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,640
Finance in the course.

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,740
Look for
readings assigned in the course outline.
